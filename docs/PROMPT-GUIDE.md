# Promptly Conversation Principles (Reference)

This is the full text that Promptly references when diagnosing prompt issues and choosing techniques. It captures the eleven sections you provided (conversation mindset, context gathering, clarifying questions, meta-prompting, rubrics, etc.). Break this into sections for easier reference.

1. **Forget magic prompts — it’s a conversation.** Talk to ChatGPT like a person; treat it as a coaching loop, not a vending machine.
2. **Talk like a human.** Share personality, tone, struggles, and accountability. Examples: real-life descriptions for weight loss, budgeting, decorating.
3. **Add context, not constraints.** Share history, failures, triggers, and goals. Context > dry rules.
4. **Ask clearly for what you want back.** Pair context with the desired output format (grocery list, plan, schedule, etc.).
5. **Give it a role or perspective.** Assign roles (coach, nutritionist, interior designer) to shape the answer.
6. **Course correct fast.** Treat first drafts as starting points; highlight friction and ask for refinements.
7. **Chain prompting.** Build the result through iterative conversation instead of single mega-prompts.
8. **Ask for clarifying questions.** Invite the AI to interview you, especially for complex requests.
9. **Meta-prompting.** Have ChatGPT improve your rough prompt, identify missing pieces, and rewrite.
10. **Reality check / rubrics (ACUC).** Have ChatGPT validate Accuracy, Completeness, Usefulness, Clarity and/or custom rubrics.
11. **Closing punch.** Keep the conversation alive; consistency beats magic words.
