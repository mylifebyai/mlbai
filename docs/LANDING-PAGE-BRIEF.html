<h1>My Life, By AI – Landing Page Brief (Audience-Aligned)</h1>
<h2>1. Purpose</h2>
<p>
Design a landing page that speaks **directly** to people who have tried to change their lives many times, failed repeatedly, and are now curious whether AI + structure could finally make change sustainable.
</p>
<p>
The page should:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Make Serial Restarters feel immediately **seen** and **safe**.</li>
<li>Explain that this is a **ChatGPT life coach documentary + systems library**, not just AI feature demos.</li>
<li>Point them clearly to **where to start on YouTube**.</li>
<li>Set expectations that failure is part of the story and the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Primary CTA: **Start the documentary on YouTube**  
<br>
Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@MyLifeByAI
</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. Audience (On-Page Framing)</h2>
<p>
We are talking to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>People who have tried 5–20+ diets or self‑help systems and &quot;failed&quot; them.</li>
<li>People with ADHD, anxiety, depression, or chronic illness who feel overwhelmed and ashamed.</li>
<li>People who can’t afford a coach or nutritionist but still want structure and accountability.</li>
<li>People who binge your content because they’re building courage to try.</li>
</ul>
<p>
They are not primarily &quot;AI nerds&quot; – they’re **struggling transformers** who see ChatGPT as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A non‑judgmental human stand‑in.</li>
<li>A way to remove decisions and build routines.</li>
<li>A system that might finally be different from all the others.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The page must **acknowledge their history of failure and shame** without triggering it further.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. Page Goals (V1)</h2>
<p>
By the time someone scrolls to the bottom, they should:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Know **this is for people like them** (serial restarters, weight‑loss desperates, ADHD organizers).</li>
<li>Understand the project as a **real‑time documentary + practical systems**, not hype.</li>
<li>Trust that you will show **failures and comebacks**, not just highlight reels.</li>
<li>Believe that the systems are **replicable and affordable** (no high‑ticket coaching required).</li>
<li>Feel clear that the **next step** is to start watching the documentary on YouTube.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>4. Page Structure &amp; Copy</h2>
<h3>4.1 Hero Section</h3>

<br>

<ul>
<li>Project name.</li>
<li>Subheading that names the audience and their pattern.</li>
<li>Primary CTA button to the YouTube channel.</li>
<li>Supporting line that normalizes failure and frames AI as a non‑judgmental partner.</li>

<hr>
<h3>4.2 What This Project Is</h3>
<p>
**Goal**  
<br>
Define the project in one clear paragraph that matches how viewers talk about it: &quot;ChatGPT as my life coach&quot;.
</p>
<p>
**Draft copy**
</p>
<p>
Heading:  
<br>
`What is “My Life, By AI”?`
</p>
<p>
Body:
</p>
<blockquote>&quot;My Life, By AI&quot; is an ongoing experiment in letting ChatGPT act as my life coach, project manager, and accountability partner.</blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>I’ve failed at diets, routines, and self-help more times than I can count. Instead of hiding that, I document it. Together with my AI coach (Arthur), I’m rebuilding my life using systems, not willpower — and showing you everything, including the relapses.</blockquote>
<p>
Key bullets (optional):
</p>
<ul>
<li>A **vlogumentary**: real‑time documentary + systems + simple science.</li>
<li>For people who have **tried everything and are tired of failing alone**.</li>
<li>Built around the idea that **failure is data**, not a dead end.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>4.3 Who This Is For</h3>
<p>
**Goal**  
<br>
Let visitors self‑identify quickly and feel seen.

<ul>
<li>You’ve tried diets, routines, and planners for years — and you’re exhausted by the cycle of restart → crash → guilt.</li>
<li>You live with ADHD, anxiety, depression, chronic pain, or other conditions that make &quot;just try harder&quot; advice useless.</li>
<li>You want structure and accountability but **can’t afford** a coach, trainer, or therapist for everything.</li>
<li>You’re curious whether an AI you can talk to in private could be the missing piece.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Short reassurance line:
</p>
<blockquote>You’re not broken and you’re not alone. You just haven’t had a system built for how your brain and life actually work.</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>4.4 The YouTube Channel (Primary CTA)</h3>
<p>

<p>

</p>
<p>
**Draft copy**
</p>
<p>
Heading:  
<br>
`Why this site exists`
</p>
<p>
Body:
</p>
<blockquote>YouTube is great for watching the journey, but terrible for keeping systems, prompts, and resources organized.</blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>This site is the home base for &quot;My Life, By AI&quot; — a place to collect the exact systems I use, the prompts you can copy, and the behind‑the‑scenes notes that don’t fit in a video description.</blockquote>

</ul>
<hr>
<h3>4.6 What’s Coming Next</h3>
<p>
**Goal**

Tease the future so the site feels like a growing hub, not a static brochure.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Heading:  
<br>
`What’s coming next`
</p>
<p>
Body:

<p>
Planned sections (bullets):
</p>
<ul>
<li>`Project log` – short written updates that track experiments and setbacks between videos.</li>
<li>`Systems library` – the exact prompts and protocols for weight loss, ADHD planning, job search, and more.</li>
<li>`Condition guides` – how I use AI alongside specific challenges like insulin resistance or chronic pain.</li>
<li>`Behind the systems` – how I maintain my manifesto, handle AI memory limits, and adapt when tools change.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
