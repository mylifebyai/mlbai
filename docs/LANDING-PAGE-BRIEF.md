# My Life, By AI – Landing Page Brief (Audience-Aligned)

## 1. Purpose

Design a landing page that speaks **directly** to people who have tried to change their lives many times, failed repeatedly, and are now curious whether AI + structure could finally make change sustainable.

The page should:
- Make Serial Restarters feel immediately **seen** and **safe**.
- Explain that this is a **ChatGPT life coach documentary + systems library**, not just AI feature demos.
- Point them clearly to **where to start on YouTube**.
- Set expectations that failure is part of the story and the system.

Primary CTA: **Start the documentary on YouTube**  
Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@MyLifeByAI

---

## 2. Audience (On-Page Framing)

We are talking to:

- People who have tried 5–20+ diets or self‑help systems and "failed" them.
- People with ADHD, anxiety, depression, or chronic illness who feel overwhelmed and ashamed.
- People who can’t afford a coach or nutritionist but still want structure and accountability.
- People who binge your content because they’re building courage to try.

They are not primarily "AI nerds" – they’re **struggling transformers** who see ChatGPT as:
- A non‑judgmental human stand‑in.
- A way to remove decisions and build routines.
- A system that might finally be different from all the others.

The page must **acknowledge their history of failure and shame** without triggering it further.

---

## 3. Page Goals (V1)

By the time someone scrolls to the bottom, they should:

- Know **this is for people like them** (serial restarters, weight‑loss desperates, ADHD organizers).
- Understand the project as a **real‑time documentary + practical systems**, not hype.
- Trust that you will show **failures and comebacks**, not just highlight reels.
- Believe that the systems are **replicable and affordable** (no high‑ticket coaching required).
- Feel clear that the **next step** is to start watching the documentary on YouTube.

### 4.2 What This Project Is

**Goal**  
Define the project in one clear paragraph that matches how viewers talk about it: "ChatGPT as my life coach".

**Draft copy**

Heading:  
`What is “My Life, By AI”?`

Body:

> "My Life, By AI" is an ongoing experiment in letting ChatGPT act as my life coach, project manager, and accountability partner.  
>  
> I’ve failed at diets, routines, and self-help more times than I can count. Instead of hiding that, I document it. Together with my AI coach (Arthur), I’m rebuilding my life using systems, not willpower — and showing you everything, including the relapses.

Key bullets (optional):

- A **vlogumentary**: real‑time documentary + systems + simple science.
- For people who have **tried everything and are tired of failing alone**.
- Built around the idea that **failure is data**, not a dead end.

**Layout & visuals**
- Section heading appears first, followed by a medium-height image directly under it:
  - Photo: beach at sunset, warm orange light, a single person running along the shoreline, footprints in the sand.
  - Caption text (overlay in the bottom-left): “Built for people who keep restarting. One more evening on the beach. One more chance to rebuild differently—with AI keeping you company in every step.”
- Under the image:
  - Blockquote and 3 bullets as above.

### 4.3 Who This Is For

**Goal**  
Let visitors self‑identify quickly and feel seen.

**Draft copy**

Heading:  
`If this sounds like you, you’re in the right place`

Bullets:

- You’ve tried diets, routines, and planners for years — and you’re exhausted by the cycle of restart → crash → guilt.
- You live with ADHD, anxiety, depression, chronic pain, or other conditions that make "just try harder" advice useless.
- You want structure and accountability but **can’t afford** a coach, trainer, or therapist for everything.
- You’re curious whether an AI you can talk to in private could be the missing piece.

Short reassurance line:

> You’re not broken and you’re not alone. You just haven’t had a system built for how your brain and life actually work.

---

### 4.4 The YouTube Channel (Primary CTA)

**Goal**  
Make it obvious that the documentary lives on YouTube and is the next step.

**Draft copy**

Heading:  
`Watch the ChatGPT life coach documentary`

Body:

> The main story happens on YouTube. That’s where you’ll see every weigh‑in, every relapse, every system tweak, and every win — in real time.

Possible bullets:

- **Documentary episodes** – long‑form, binge‑able videos showing the journey.
- **Full tutorials** – copy‑paste prompts and systems for weight loss, job search, and more.
- **Failure and recovery** – episodes where things fall apart and we rebuild.

Button (repeat CTA):

- Label: `Start watching on YouTube`
- Link: `https://www.youtube.com/@MyLifeByAI`

Optional supporting text:

> If you’re not ready to start yet, you can just watch. A lot of people do that first.

**Layout & visuals**
- Two-column layout on desktop:
  - Left: heading, body, bullets, CTA button, and supporting text as above.
  - Right: an image-style card that looks like a mini video player (or the real embedded player when allowed):
    - Label: “Your journey, in chapters”.
    - Dark “player” box with either:
      - A horizontal gradient progress bar (orange → yellow).
      - Meta line: “Week 12 · Cravings & comeback” and a duration (e.g., “42 min”).
      - Three small rectangular thumbnail blocks underneath (soft orange gradients).  
      **or**
      - An embedded YouTube player (iframe) for a featured episode.
- Stacked vertically on mobile (text first, then image card).

### 4.5 Why This Site Exists

**Goal**  
Explain why they should care about this website if the content is on YouTube.

**Draft copy**

Heading:  
`Why this site exists`

Body:

> YouTube is great for watching the journey, but terrible for keeping systems, prompts, and resources organized.  
>  
> This site is the home base for "My Life, By AI" — a place to collect the exact systems I use, the prompts you can copy, and the behind‑the‑scenes notes that don’t fit in a video description.

Optional bullets:

- Find **where to start** in the documentary, based on your situation.
- Get **written breakdowns** of key systems and episodes.
- Explore **condition‑specific guides** (ADHD, insulin resistance, chronic pain, etc.) as they’re released.

---

### 4.6 What’s Coming Next

**Goal**  
Tease the future so the site feels like a growing hub, not a static brochure.

**Draft copy**

Heading:  
`What’s coming next`

Body:

> This is the first version of the site. Over time, it will grow into a hub for people who want to build their own AI‑powered Life OS.

Planned sections (bullets):

- `Project log` – short written updates that track experiments and setbacks between videos.
- `Systems library` – the exact prompts and protocols for weight loss, ADHD planning, job search, and more.
- `Condition guides` – how I use AI alongside specific challenges like insulin resistance or chronic pain.
- `Behind the systems` – how I maintain my manifesto, handle AI memory limits, and adapt when tools change.

**Layout & visuals**
- Two-column layout on desktop:
  - Left: heading, body text, and four small “cards” for the planned sections (as listed above).
  - Right: an image-style card representing a simple AI-powered daily dashboard (“Life OS”):
    - Label: “Your AI-powered Life OS”.
    - Warm yellow/orange panel with rows such as:
      - `Today` – pill “Checked in”.
      - `Movement` – “15 / 30 min”.
      - `Food plan` – “3 of 4 meals”.
      - `Energy & mood` – “Steady ↑”.
- Stacked vertically on mobile (text/cards first, then Life OS card).

**What the community says**
- Appears near the bottom, before “Stay connected”.
- Left: heading, short paragraph, and 2–3 key viewer quotes.
- Right: card summarising why people trust the project (public failures, no paywalled prompts, real results like lower A1C, better jobs, etc.).

---

### 4.7 Stay Connected (Optional in V1)

If you already have or plan to add other community touchpoints, this section can appear near the bottom.

Heading:  
`Stay connected`

Bullets (examples, adjust to what exists):

Recommended metadata:

- Title:  
  `My Life, By AI – A ChatGPT Life Coach Documentary for People Who’ve Tried Everything`

- Meta description:  
  `For people who’ve failed diets and self-help plans over and over, My Life, By AI is a real-time documentary of using ChatGPT as a non-judgmental life coach to rebuild health, work, and habits with systems—not willpower.`

- Open Graph:
  - OG title similar to page title.
  - OG description similar to meta description.
  - OG image: simple graphic with project name and tagline (no heavy branding needed).

---

## 7. Success Criteria (V1)

We’ll consider the v1 landing page successful if:

- Serial Restarters land on the page and think, **"This is me"** within a few seconds.
- Visitors understand that this is a **documented, messy, real transformation**, not a polished highlight reel.
- The YouTube CTA is clear and gets clicked by people who resonate.
- The page sets accurate expectations: systems + science + story, with failure included.
- Comments and messages begin to echo language from the page ("I’ve tried everything", "this makes me feel less alone").
