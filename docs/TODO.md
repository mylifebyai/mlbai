[x] Step 1: Scaffold Manifesto Builder route/page with basic layout and feature gating.
[ ] Step 2: Add chat-style interview UI + local state machine (no backend yet).
    - [ ] Test the flow: run full scan, mark some high-importance areas (7+), answer deep-dive prompts, and confirm it reaches “ready to draft.”
    - [ ] Tidy usability as needed while testing (spacing, readability, controls).
[ ] Step 3: Wire backend persistence (endpoint + storage) for manifesto drafts and convo logs (user-owned).
[ ] Step 4: Add manifesto draft generation step (2–3k words) and render in UI.
[ ] Step 5: Build refinement loop (user edits/requests rewrites, regenerate draft).
[ ] Step 6: Generate goals + trackers + mandatory habits from approved manifesto; add review/approve UI.
[ ] Step 7: Implement PDF export (manifesto, goals, trackers, habits).
[ ] Step 8: Add polish: privacy messaging, loading/empty states, navigation entry, and QA pass.
