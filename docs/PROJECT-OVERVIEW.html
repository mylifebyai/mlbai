<h1>My Life, By AI – Project Overview &amp; Plan (Audience-Aligned)</h1>
<h2>1. What This Project Is</h2>
<p>
&quot;My Life, By AI&quot; is a long‑form, real‑time documentary of a person who has failed at traditional self‑improvement over and over, using ChatGPT (Arthur) as a non‑judgmental life coach and system builder.
</p>
<p>
The project lives primarily on YouTube, but this site is the **home base** for:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The documentary itself (what to watch, in what order).</li>
<li>The systems and prompts behind the transformation.</li>
<li>Written breakdowns of what works, what fails, and why.</li>
<li>The community and, eventually, the app/Life OS that people can use themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This document explains:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Who we are building for.</li>
<li>What problems we are solving for them.</li>
<li>What makes this project different from other AI or self‑improvement content.</li>
<li>How the website and tech stack support that mission.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>2. Who This Is For</h2>
<p>
The core viewer is **the Serial Restarter** – someone who has tried to change their life many times and feels like they keep failing the same way.
</p>
<h3>Demographics (high level)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Primarily 25–55 years old.</li>
<li>Global, with strong presence in US, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada.</li>
<li>Mixed gender, slight female lean.</li>
<li>Life stages: mid‑career professionals, parents, students, retirees.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Psychographics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Has tried &quot;everything&quot; before (multiple diets, gym memberships, self‑help books).</li>
<li>Struggles with **consistency**, not information.</li>
<li>Stuck in cycles: motivation → crash → guilt → restart.</li>
<li>Often living with ADHD, anxiety, depression, chronic illness, or mobility issues.</li>
<li>Feels isolated and ashamed of repeated failures.</li>
<li>Tech‑comfortable but not necessarily tech‑savvy.</li>
<li>Values **authenticity over polish**.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Audience Segments</h3>
<p>
1. **The Weight Loss Desperates**  
<br>
   Repeated diet failures, often 50–150+ lbs to lose, health complications emerging or worsening. They need systems for meal planning, hunger management, emotional eating, and non‑scale victory tracking.
</p>
<p>
2. **The ADHD/Neurodivergent Organizers**  
<br>
   Diagnosed or suspected ADHD/autism/executive dysfunction. They have ideas but struggle with initiation, organization, and follow‑through. They need decision reduction, task breakdown, and gentle accountability without shame.
</p>
<p>
3. **The Vicarious Transformers**  
<br>
   Not ready to start themselves yet, but binge‑watching your journey to build courage. They want honest struggle, long‑form storytelling, and a community they can observe before joining.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. Core Problems We’re Solving</h2>
<p>
From comments and behavior, the main pain points are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>**Chronic failure cycles**</li>
<p>
  &quot;I’ve tried dozens of diets&quot;, &quot;Every diet’s always failed&quot;.
</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>**Lack of accountability**</li>
<p>
  &quot;I quit when I’m winning&quot;, &quot;I get depressed and just stay there&quot;.
</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>**Decision overload**</li>
<p>
  &quot;Brain bombarded with ideas, never know where to start&quot;.
</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>**Cost barriers**</li>
<p>
  Can’t afford coaches, trainers, nutritionists, or therapists.
</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>**Shame and judgment**</li>
<p>
  Don’t want to talk to a real human about failures and health.
</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>**Complex health and neurodivergent realities**</li>
<p>
  Gout, prediabetes, OSA, insulin resistance, chronic pain, ADHD, autism, chronic fatigue.
</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>**Emotional eating and self‑sabotage**</li>
<p>
  Most people don’t quit from hunger; they quit from emotional overwhelm.
</p>
</ul>
<p>
The project’s promise is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Your failures are not personal defects.</li>
<li>Structure beats willpower.</li>
<li>Accountability can be non‑judgmental.</li>
<li>Systems can replace shame.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>4. What Makes This Project Unique</h2>
<p>
This is not &quot;AI content&quot; for its own sake. It’s a **ChatGPT life coach documentary** for people who have failed repeatedly.
</p>
<p>
Key differentiators:
</p>
<p>
1. **Documented transformation, not theory**  
</p>
<ul>
<li>70+ lbs lost, 8× job callback improvement, and 6+ months of sustained change.</li>
<li>Viewers can see the systems in action over time, not just before/after snapshots.</li>
</ul>
<p>
2. **Radical transparency about failure**  
</p>
<ul>
<li>Nachos, binges, skipped workouts, depressive episodes – they’re all on camera.</li>
<li>Failure is framed as data, not the end.</li>
</ul>
<p>
3. **&quot;Failure is part of the system&quot; philosophy**  
</p>
<ul>
<li>Goal: get back up faster, not never fall.</li>
<li>Relapse and recovery are designed into the protocols.</li>
</ul>
<p>
4. **Practical systems over motivation**  
</p>
<ul>
<li>Not selling willpower or pep talks.</li>
<li>Selling decision removal, structure, prompts, and adaptive plans.</li>
<li>&quot;You don’t need answers, you need a system.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>
5. **ChatGPT as non‑judgmental human stand‑in**  
</p>
<ul>
<li>Human enough to feel accountable to, robot enough to not feel ashamed.</li>
<li>Personified as Arthur, which makes AI feel like a partner, not a tool demo.</li>
</ul>
<p>
6. **Whole‑life transformation, not single‑issue**  
</p>
<ul>
<li>Weight, career, mental health, mobility, food, planning – all connected.</li>
<li>One Life OS instead of a dozen separate hacks.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>5. Content &amp; Format Philosophy – The Vlogumentary</h2>
<p>
Every major piece of content aims to answer:
</p>
<blockquote>I help **[who]** to **[what]** so they can **[why]**.</blockquote>
<p>
The format is a **vlogumentary** – a hybrid of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>**Story** – real‑time, vulnerable documentation of struggle and change.</li>
<li>**Science** – simple, visual explanations of what’s happening in the brain/body.</li>
<li>**System** – concrete prompts, rules, and check‑ins people can copy.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Ideal narrative loop for episodes:
</p>
<p>
1. **The Problem (Story)**  
<br>
   Vulnerable hook about a real issue: exhaustion, cravings, identity drift, relapse.
</p>
<p>
2. **The Hypothesis (Science)**  
<br>
   A short explanation of the underlying psychology/biology.
</p>
<p>
3. **The System (Solution)**  
<br>
   Arthur + you design a protocol: rules, prompts, measurements.
</p>
<p>
4. **The Experiment (Story‑in‑Action)**  
<br>
   Vlog footage of trying the protocol – including failures and adjustments.
</p>
<p>
5. **The Reflection (Science + Story)**  
<br>
   Data, graphs, and emotional insights about what happened.
</p>
<p>
6. **The Integration (System)**  
<br>
   Takeaways viewers can apply, including copy‑paste prompts.
</p>
<p>
This loop gives viewers empathy (they feel seen), structure (they see a path), and understanding (they know why it works).
</p>
<hr>
<h2>6. Website – Version 1 Scope</h2>
<p>
The v1 website is small on purpose. It exists to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearly state **who this is for**: people who have tried everything and are tired of failing alone.</li>
<li>Explain **what the project is**: a ChatGPT life‑coach documentary + systems library.</li>
<li>Direct visitors to **where to start**: the main YouTube channel and key flagship videos.</li>
<li>Hint at **what’s coming next**: project logs, system guides, condition‑specific protocols, and an eventual app.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The v1 landing page should answer, quickly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Is this for someone like me (serial restarter, ADHD, chronic conditions)?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Will you actually show the failures, not just the highlights?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Can I copy this system without paying for an expensive program?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>
Primary call‑to‑action: **Start the documentary on YouTube**  
<br>
Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@MyLifeByAI
</p>
<hr>
<h2>7. Tech Stack Plan</h2>
<p>
We’re choosing tools that make it easy to ship a simple landing page now and a richer hub later.
</p>
<ul>
<li>**Framework**: Next.js</li>
<p>
  Static‑friendly, great SEO, and simple routing for future sections (logs, resources, app pages).
</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>**Language**: React + TypeScript</li>
<p>
  Type safety for faster iteration as systems and UI naturally grow more complex.
</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>**Styling**: Tailwind CSS or lightweight CSS Modules</li>
<p>
  Start with clean, minimal layouts. No heavy design system required.
</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>**Hosting**: Vercel (or similar)</li>
<p>
  Easy deployments from this repo, solid support for Next.js features, good performance.
</p>
</ul>
<p>
Why this matters for the audience:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Good SEO helps &quot;struggling transformers&quot; actually find this when they search.</li>
<li>Fast, clean pages respect their limited energy and attention.</li>
<li>A modern stack makes it realistic to ship tools (Life OS, protocols, downloads) on the same domain later.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>8. Docs &amp; Repo Structure</h2>
<p>
We use a `docs` folder to keep internal thinking and external copy aligned.
</p>
<p>
Planned docs:
</p>
<ul>
<li>`docs/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md`</li>
<p>
  This document – the audience‑aligned overview and plan.
</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>`docs/LANDING-PAGE-BRIEF.md`</li>
<p>
  Detailed content and structure for the landing page.
</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>`docs/AUDIENCE-ANALYSIS.md` (optional)</li>
<p>
  A lightly edited version of the full audience analysis you already created, for quick reference during future decisions.
</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>`docs/CONTENT-STRATEGY.md` (future)</li>
<p>
  How tutorials, documentary episodes, and systems content interlock.
</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>`docs/ROADMAP.md` (future)</li>
<p>
  Concrete milestones for the channel, site, community, and app.
</p>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>9. Roadmap (High Level)</h2>
<p>
**Phase 1 – Foundations**
</p>
<ul>
<li>Capture the audience analysis and POV in docs.</li>
<li>Ship a v1 landing page that speaks directly to Serial Restarters.</li>
<li>Make the YouTube channel the clear starting point.</li>
</ul>
<p>
**Phase 2 – Storytelling Hub**
</p>
<ul>
<li>Add guides to &quot;what to watch first&quot; and episode paths (e.g., weight‑loss arc, job‑search arc, ADHD systems arc).</li>
<li>Create simple written summaries for key videos (problem → system → result).</li>
</ul>
<p>
**Phase 3 – Systems Hub**
</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish copy‑paste prompts and protocols (weight loss, ADHD planning, job search, etc.).</li>
<li>Add condition‑specific guides (e.g., insulin resistance, chronic pain, ADHD).</li>
<li>Document how to adapt the Life OS to other AI tools if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
**Phase 4 – Community &amp; App**
</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrate Discord/Patreon/email into the site as the community backbone.</li>
<li>Begin exposing the Life OS/app as a productized system.</li>
<li>Keep content and tools affordable and non‑exploitative.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>10. Principles We’ll Follow</h2>
<ul>
<li>**Radical honesty**</li>
<p>
  Show the whole cycle: relapse, regret, and recovery. This is the moat.
</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>**System over motivation**</li>
<p>
  Always pair the &quot;why&quot; with the &quot;how&quot; and the actual prompts.
</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>**Fail forward**</li>
<p>
  Treat failure as data and design recovery into every protocol.
</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>**Accessibility and replicability**</li>
<p>
  Use tools and workflows that viewers can realistically copy, even without a big budget.
</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>**Protect the audience**</li>
<p>
  Avoid exploitative monetization, respect privacy concerns, and be explicit about what AI can’t replace (e.g., professional mental health care).
</p>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>**Community over algorithm**</li>
<p>
  Prioritize the people who are changing their lives with this system over chasing trends or purely viral formats.
</p>
</ul>
